Q1) Two ways to create a new thread. First = declare a class to be a subclass of
Thread, this should override the run method of class Thread. Second = declare a
class that implements the Runnable interface, which also implements the run
method.

Q2) Both must contain run method.

Q3) start() method.

Q4) Just code for Server as it is definitley a server, no checks required to see
if it is a client or a Server.

Q5) Line 14/15 creates a Thread, using specific input and output params, and
then starts the created thread. 
- Line 14 forwards input to socket - the SENDER
- Line 15 takes input from socket and forwards it to the output stream - the RECIEVER

Q6) WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

Q7) 
public class Client {
public static void main(String[] args){
try{
int port = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
Socket socket = new Socket(args[1], port);
System.err.println("Connected to " + args[1] + " on port " + port);
new ReadWriteThread(System.in, socket.getOutputStream()).start();
new ReadWriteThread(socket.getInputStream(), System.out).start();
}
}
}

Q8) Due to some fruits trying to print at the same time on one thread, thus causing some
to be interruptted while printing.
